##Public Functions
`TicTacToeBoard()`

___

`Piece placePiece(int row, int column)`

*Places the piece of the current turn on the board, returns what piece is 
placed, and toggles which Piece's turn it is. placePiece does NOT allow to 
place a piece in a location where there is already a piece. In that case, 
placePiece just returns what is already at that location. Out of bounds 
coordinates return the Piece Invalid value.*

`Piece getPiece(int row, int column)`

*Returns what piece is at the provided coordinates, or Blank if there
are no pieces there, or Invalid if the coordinates are out of bounds*
___

`Piece getWinner()`

*Returns which Piece has won, if there is a winner, Invalid if the game
is not over, or Blank if the board is filled and no one has won.*
